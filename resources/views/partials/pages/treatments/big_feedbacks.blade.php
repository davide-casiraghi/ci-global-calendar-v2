            "I find Ilan's work an amazing gift to dancers and people alike. His work helps the body's own regeneration. It brings movement to blocked areas in the body, it comes with positive energy and a sense of joy, it can help quicker recovery from "fresh injuries" as well as heal ״old״ ones... It helped me to become more efficient with my movement and gave me a more balanced body... His work is intelligent, thoughtful, considerate, and serves as a constant research method for growth, for Ilan himself as well as for those he works with."

            "The doctors in San Diego have recommended that I go to an urgent operation...after surviving 20-hours of a horrible long-distance flight, from the West Coast to Tel-Aviv, I met my old friend Ilan Lev. Within two-three weeks I went back to conduct the symphonic orchestra in San Diego... To the great surprise of the hospital doctors there...They could not believe the 'miracle' that has just occurred."
