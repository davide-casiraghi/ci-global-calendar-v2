                        During a session, the practitioner brings to the body of the receiver a wide variety of movements, vibrations, playful provocations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These create the environment in which the body's natural ability to heal itself can arise, we discover an optimal range of motion, efficiency of effort, and a new understanding of ourselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This allows new physical pathways and coordinations to emerge or become clearer, old habits to be thrown out, and physical and emotional trauma to be released.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this way, the movement returns to parts of the body where communication was cut-off or stopped due to injury, pain, or emotional issues. And the dialogue within the whole system is restored.
